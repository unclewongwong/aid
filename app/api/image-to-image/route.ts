REFERENCE IMAGE RECOGNITION AND CONSISTENCY RULES:
- Treat the reference image as a strict identity, geometry, proportion, material, color, and scale guide.
- Preserve the main subject identity, structure, proportions, silhouette, materials, colors, texture, and all key details from the reference image.
- Keep every recognizable person, object, product, logo/text detail, outfit, accessory, and surface material faithful to the reference.
- If the reference contains a product, preserve its exact shape, packaging, material, color, logo/text details, size impression, and design language.
- If the reference contains a person, preserve facial identity, hairstyle, body proportions, clothing identity, accessories, pose logic, and natural skin texture.
- Preserve the relative scale relationship between people and objects: hand-to-object size, body-to-product size, object height/width/depth impression, distance, placement, contact points, and perspective.
- Do not enlarge, shrink, stretch, flatten, or redesign referenced objects unless the user explicitly asks.
- If user scale or dimension notes are provided, follow them as hard constraints for object proportions and person-object scale relationships.

STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHY QUALITY:
- Professional studio photo shoot, ultra realistic, premium commercial photography.
- Clean high-end set design, controlled softbox lighting, natural contact shadows, realistic reflections.
- Sharp details, realistic texture, balanced highlights, no overexposure.
- 50mm or 85mm lens look, shallow depth of field when appropriate, crisp subject separation.
- Premium editorial composition, polished but natural.

NEGATIVE RULES:
- No deformation, no warped anatomy, no extra limbs, no duplicate subjects.
- No random text, no watermark, no subtitles, no UI elements.
- Do not add logos or text unless they already exist in the reference image and should be preserved.
- Do not change the core subject into a different object or person.`;
