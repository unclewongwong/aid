IDENTITY SOURCE
${identityRule}
Character description: ${clean(input.description)}.
Locked wardrobe and grooming: ${clean(input.costumeDesc)}.
Role / identity: ${clean(input.role)}.
Approximate age: ${clean(input.age)}.
Personality keywords: ${clean(input.personality)}.
Core theme: ${clean(input.coreTheme)}.

DESIGN METADATA STRIP
- Add a clean top information strip with readable English labels only: character name, role/identity, approximate age when known, 3–5 personality keywords, and one short core theme sentence.
- Keep the typography minimal and technical. No logos, watermarks, decorative branding, or unrelated text.

BOARD CONTENT
- Main identity display: largest area of the board. Show the same character in full-body front, three-quarter, side, and back views; standard standing pose; simple height/proportion guide lines; no handheld props in the primary turnaround unless they are physically attached to the costume/body.
- Silhouette lock: front and side black/flat silhouettes that preserve the exact head shape, hair outline, shoulder width, torso/limb proportions, costume outline, and footwear footprint.
- Expression system: 8 consistent head/face panels showing calm, curious, tense, surprised, afraid, sad, determined, and relaxed. Keep the same facial structure/head design in every expression.
- Micro-expression system: 5 close panels showing eye tension, slight smile, mouth pressure, subtle fear, and controlled breathing. These should be small acting variations, not redesigns.
- Head construction: multi-angle head studies from front/three-quarter/profile/low-angle/high-angle, preserving skull shape, jawline or muzzle/head topology, hairline, ears/horns/markings, and eye spacing.
- Pose variations: relaxed, tense, and confident full/half-body poses that keep the same anatomy, costume, and silhouette.
- Emotional close-up: one chest-up cinematic close-up with strong story emotion while preserving identity.
- Wardrobe and material details: 4 detail panels for hairstyle/head features, fabric or surface material, accessories/marks/fasteners, and shoes/feet. Include real material behavior appropriate to the medium: skin, cloth, metal, fur, plastic, armor, or stylized linework as applicable.
- Hand/action details: relaxed hand, tense hand, pointing, gripping, and hand-to-face gesture. For non-human characters, replace with species-appropriate paws/claws/appendages and contact poses.
- Continuity palette: 6–8 clean color/material chips sampled from the design; color blocks only, no text inside the chips.
- If the subject is non-human, replace human-specific views with species-appropriate head, paws/hands/feet, markings, silhouette, and scale details.

LAYOUT AND RENDERING
Clean technical editorial grid on pure white, off-white, or minimal warm neutral background. The main identity display must be visually dominant. Use generous spacing, unobstructed silhouettes, consistent scale and perspective, clear English section labels, and cinematic yet neutral studio lighting. High-end production design document suitable as a downstream image/video reference.
Keep the source medium intact: real people remain natural live action with truthful skin texture and believable photographic lighting; realistic 3D stays realistic 3D with accurate materials; stylized 3D keeps its sculpted/stylized surface language; anime/illustration/IP design retains its exact drawing, shape, line, shading, and rendering language.

HARD CONSTRAINTS
One identity only. Every module must be based on the same character structure. No duplicate people presented as different identities, no face drift, no wardrobe redesign, no hairstyle changes, no body-proportion changes, no style drift, no mixed media, no modern/fantasy/sci-fi additions unless specified, no extra limbs or anatomy errors, no cropped feet in turnaround views, no busy scenic background, no random props, no unreadable gibberish labels, no logos, no watermark.

CHARACTER DESCRIPTION RULES (Visual Specificity)
- FORBIDDEN abstract adjectives: "fashionable", "attractive", "beautiful", "stylish", "elegant", "charming"
- REQUIRED concrete visual details: specific clothing items with colors and textures, precise hairstyle description, makeup level, visible accessories
- Example WRONG: "a fashionable young woman"
- Example RIGHT: "woman in her early 20s, faded charcoal sleeveless crop top, high-waist light-wash denim jeans, black canvas sneakers, black woven cord necklace, black wavy long hair in messy side ponytail with wispy bangs, natural daily makeup"
- Every character description must end with: "Consistent identity, costume, hairstyle and appearance throughout the video."

CONCEPT EXPLORATION
Every cell shows one full-body concept of the same story role, facing mostly forward in a neutral readable pose. Explore meaningful alternatives in silhouette, proportion, hairstyle or head shape, costume cut, material balance and one signature detail. Keep the requested age, identity cues, personality, role and visual medium stable. Candidates must feel intentionally different, not recolors or tiny variations.

GRID RULES
Exactly ${input.candidateCount} equal cells, ${grid}, read left-to-right and top-to-bottom. One character per cell, centered, fully visible from head to feet, consistent scale, simple warm-white studio background, thin neutral gutters, no overlap between cells. No titles, numbers, captions, logos, watermark, scenery, props that hide the silhouette, duplicate character inside a cell, extra people, extra limbs, cropped feet, mixed media or unreadable text.

The sheet is a selection board, not the final turnaround. Prioritize clear identity, silhouette and production-ready design differences.

CAPTURE METHOD:
${buildImageCapturePresetContract(input.capturePreset)}

COMPOSITION:
Use a wide environmental master shot with readable foreground, middle ground, and background geography. ${cast ? 'Keep the principal character at roughly 20–35% of frame height so the production world remains dominant; no close-up, studio portrait, or full-frame fashion pose. The character participates in the location instead of posing against a blank backdrop.' : 'Keep the location empty, with no characters. Preserve the described architecture, landmarks and entrances.'} Use one motivated feature-film camera position, physical lighting, real material response, and enough environmental context for later storyboard frames to inherit the same production world.

OUTPUT:
One clean ${input.aspectRatio || '16:9'} film frame with no grid, alternate poses, captions, subtitles, labels, logos, watermark, UI, or readable text.
