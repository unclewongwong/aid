Four supporting full-body photographs show front, three-quarter, side and back views with the complete body and costume visible. All views show the same individual, grooming and clothing at a consistent scale. Relaxed weight-bearing posture and neutral expression. An unobtrusive plain gray fitting-room backdrop. No diagrams, silhouette cutouts, color swatches or tiny expression grids. No text, labels or borders.

PHOTOGRAPHIC TREATMENT: ${fittingLight}

Fantasy beings remain the same species and anatomy, portrayed as physically present creatures with believable skin, scales, fur and costume contact, never redesigned into human actors or game characters.
